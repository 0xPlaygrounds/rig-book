# Who is this book for?
Rust for Applied AI (which we will refer to as "Rust for AI") specifically is an extremely emergent domain that has been receiving increased amounts of interest recently as time has gone on and the wider developer community have started trying to adopt Rust for AI.

Eventually, we want this book to be useful for all kinds of developers. However at the moment for the purposes of scope, the people likely to benefit the most are the following demographics below:

## Rust engineers
If you are using Rust in any capacity (whether as a hobbyist, or as part of a Rust company), this book is for you specifically. Using Rust, you can write AI systems without needing to context switch into Python while still getting the speed and reliability benefits that a traditional system in Rust depends on. This book will lay the foundations for you to be able to make a non-deterministic system that generates its outputs based on ground truths rather than prompting and hoping for the best.

## AI Engineers who are trying Rust
If you are currently working with AI as part of your day job, now has never been a better time to invest into Rust for AI. Recently there has been a lot of grassroots movement on moving the frontier forward, with many passionate developers working on new projects. With regards to Rig, we've achieved production usage by external companies - not just startups on the edge, but well-known AI startups as well as larger, more traditional companies.

## AI companies
If you are part of a company that specialises in AI, you are likely using Python or Typescript. Your team likely already knows how brittle and resource-intensive Python (and to a lesser extent, Typescript) can be in production. With so much momentum starting to build up in the Rust for AI space, being an early adopter means you can take full advantage of all the upcoming libraries and projects being written in Rust. Whether you just want to leverage an API like Meilisearch, importing a Rust module into your Python code as a PyO3 module, or you simply just want to write a humble internal CLI tool: Rust has it.
