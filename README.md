## The Rig Playbook
This repo is the GitHub repo for the Rig playbook.

## Development
If you are interested in contributing, you will need [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) installed.

You then need to run the following to get the book to generate and hot-reload the HTML for development:

```
mdbook serve
```
